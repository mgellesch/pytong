#Installing !PyTong

= System Requirements =

 * *Python*
 * *wxPython*
   try 'import wx' from the Python interpreter to see if wx is installed. 
   If it's not, get it at [http://www.wxpython.org]

== Windows ==

The Downloads page contains an installer for Windows. It will install into `C:\Program Files` by default, and add a !PyTong entry to the Start Menu.
The installer checks the registry for whichever application is set up to handle .pyw files (windowed Python programs) and uses it to launch !PyTong.

== OS X ==

The Downloads page contains a disk image for OS X. It contains a ready to run application bundle which you can drag to `/Applications` or anywhere else. Recent versions of OS X have Python and wxPython installed by default. If you have installed a newer Python yourself, install wxPython as well (try 'import wx' from the interpreter to check for wx).

== Linux / other ==

Right now there is no source distribution yet, but you can checkout the latest version with Subversion. To run !PyTong, run the script `gui.py`.

Example:
{{{
svn checkout http://pytong.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pytong
cd pytong
python gui.py
}}}
