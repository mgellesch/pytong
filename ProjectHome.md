PyTong is a graphical front end to the Python 'unittest' module. It shows a tree view with all the tests from the TestCase derived classes in a module. Tests are run in a background thread and can be started and stopped from the GUI.

Grondwerk IT uses PyTong with the Selenium web application testing system to test web sites with Python scripts. A ready to run sample using Selenium is included (but needs a Java environment already installed).

PyTong runs on systems with Python and the wxPython module installed. Installers are available for Windows and OS X.
